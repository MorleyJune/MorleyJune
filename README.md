I made mini quiz games for Quiz Society of School of Medicine in Yamagata University.
And I also made videos about physical experiment of PokÃ©mon.
The left one is about Ponyta, and the right one is about Dragonite.
The left one is very logical, but the right one is very humorous.
You can choose which one you watch.

If you cannot understand Japanese, Don't worry. I prepared English Subtitles to it.

Now, I'm making some IoT device for World's Health, not only entertainment.
Please look for.
