I made mini quiz games for Quiz Society of School of Medicine in Yamagata University.
And I also made videos about physical experiment of PokÃ©mon.
The 1st one is about Ponyta, and the 2nd one is about Dragonite.
The 1st one is very logical, but the 2nd one is very humorous.
You can choose which one you watch.

If you cannot understand Japanese, Don't worry. I prepared English Subtitles to it.

Now, I'm making some IoT device for health, not just entertainment.
Please look for.
